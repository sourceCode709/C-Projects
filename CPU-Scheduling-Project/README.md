Implementation of the First-come, first-served (FCFS), Shortest-job-first (SJF), Priority scheduling, Round-robin (RR) scheduling, 
and Priority with round-robin CPU scheduling algorithms. Computes the average waiting time, turnaround time and response time of 
each algorithm to compare the performance of each algorithm. The algorithms are tested with various input files containing varying
priorities and CPU burst times.
